Anthony was extremely generous with his time and knowledge as he coached me on skills needed for a role in financial analysis. Anthony became a mentor and was always available to provide guidance to help me succeed. He actively sought opportunities to get me involved in any deals he was working on and was clearly well-versed with his client's needs and performance. He is very talented at modeling different scenarios, and clearly communicating his thought process and methodologies. Anthony's technical skills and work ethic are second to none, and have set a high bar of expectation within our group. I now work full-time at the Bank and I am sad to see him go. I can speak for our whole team when I say that he will be missed."
